Task1: Configure EIGRP AS 100 on all devices in the topology.

Task2: Enable EIGRP on all interfaces in the 150.1.0.0/16 and 155.1.0.0/16 networks on all devices.
>  Any new interfaces added should not automatically be advertised into EIGRP, regardless of their IPv4 addresses.

Task3: For verification, all devices should have full IPv4 reachability throughout the network.
