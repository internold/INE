Task1: R9 and R10 are configured for BGP in AS 54 and all other routers for BGP in AS 100.
Task2: Configure EBGP peerings between R7 and R9, between R8 and R10 using their directly connected links.

R7:
!
router bgp 100
 neighbor 155.1.79.9 remote-as 54
!

R8:
!
router bgp 100
 neighbor 155.1.108.10 remote-as 54
!


Task3: Advertise the directly connected links between R7 and R9, between R8 and R10 into EIGRP 100.

R7:
!
router eigrp 100
 network 155.1.79.0 0.0.0.255
!

R8:
!
router eigrp 100
 network 155.1.108.0 0.0.0.255
!

Task4: Ensure full IPv4 reachability to all prefixes learned from AS 54, from all routers in AS 100 when sourcing traffic from Loopback0 interfaces.
